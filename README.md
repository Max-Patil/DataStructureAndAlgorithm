# Versatile Data Structures And Algorithms
This project is a compact yet versatile collection of data structures and algorithms, designed to be adaptable to various data types, sizes, and 
algorithmic patterns. This project depicts my C programming skills along with foundation of data structures and algorithms.

# Features
* Generic Linked Lists - This is a collection encompassing all variations of linked lists, designed to support data of any type, functioning similarly to a generic container which is achieved using void pointers.
  
* NDimensional Array - This section contains implementation that extends the concept of arrays beyond the traditional one or two dimensions. By utilizing the idea of strides to one-dimensional arrays, this structure efficiently simulates multidimensional arrays in a linear storage space. To make it syntatically flexible, variadic functions are used, allowing the array to accept a variable number of dimensions.

* Generic Sorts - This section contains implementation of insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort that can be used to sort any container according to sorting criteria provided through callback function by client programmer. Notably, both Insertion Sort and Merge Sort are also compatible with linked data structures, demonstrating their versatility and adaptability to different types of containers beyond traditional arrays.

* Data Structures Patterns - This section contains different data structure patterns such as heap, binary search tree, hashtable, deque and two stacks to which different algorithmic patterns suits.

I express my profound gratitude towards them as their teachings and practical exercises provided by them were instrumental in shaping my foundation and advancing my skills.
Only after, armed with these skills I created another projects.
